S1: Click on button(anchor tag) "Login with google"

s2: Redirects user to "/auth-google" and calls function "googleAuth"

s3: "googleAuth" function uses "passport.authenticate" which tells passport to use google strategy and asks for profile(name) & email.

s4: This redirects to "callback" route and send profile and email .

s5: we call "googleResponseHandler" function that calls authenticate function again and generates jwt token and stores in cookie.


MODIFY FROM S4 LATER , MAKE IT MORE CLEARER.
